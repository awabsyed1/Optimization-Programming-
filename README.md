Optimization Programming / Algorithm for finding minimum 

Penalty Method to solve constrained minimization problem. Constraints are sued to define a penalty term which is added to the original objective function. Any point that is outside the feasible region will be penalized, penalty methods always favous those points which are in the feasible regin 
Additional Methods were compared:
	Genetic Algorithm 
	Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO 
	Simulated Annealing
