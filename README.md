Unconstrained non-linear optimization using MATLAB function, 'fminunc' to minimize Rosenbrock function 

Nature and bio-inspired Moth-Flame Optimization 
In the last three decades, a great number of derive-free methods and algorithms have been  developed for solving hard optimization problems; thse include the widely used, nature and bio-inspired, population based methaheuristics which are related to evolutionary computation and artificial intelligence 



Matlab function, 'fmincon' for constrained optimization with initial values provided 


Penalty Method to solve constrained minimization problem. Constraints are sued to define a penalty term which is added to the original objective function. Any point that is outside the feasible region will be penalized, penalty methods always favous those points which are in the feasible regin 
Additional Methods were compared:
	Genetic Algorithm 
	Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO 
	Simulated Annealing 


Constrained Minimization using MATLAB toolboxes.  MATLAB functions, 'fmincon', 'ga' and 'particleswarm' were used to solve the problem
